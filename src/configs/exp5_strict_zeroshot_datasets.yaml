# Configuration for EXP-5: Strict Cross-Domain Zero-Shot Evaluation
# Objective: Validate true zero-shot generalization by removing all overlapping domains from pretraining.
# KEEP ONLY:
# - Healthcare: Covid Deaths, Hospital
# - Generic benchmarks: M1, M3, M4, NN5

datasets_to_load:
  # Healthcare
  - monash_covid_deaths
  - monash_hospital
  
  # Generic Benchmarks
  # M1
  - monash_m1_monthly
  - monash_m1_quarterly
  - monash_m1_yearly
  
  # M3
  - monash_m3_monthly
  - monash_m3_quarterly
  - monash_m3_yearly
  
  # M4
  - m4_yearly
  - m4_hourly
  - m4_monthly
  # (m4_daily, m4_weekly, m4_quarterly are also available in typical m4 sets, 
  # but user specified "M4" broadly. I will include the common ones listed in the example or known to exist)
  # Based on cronos_loader_example.yaml, "m4_yearly" etc are used. 
  # I'll add the full suite if possible/standard, but for now stick to what I saw or variations likely to exist.
  # Let's verify M4 keys if I can, but proceeding with the ones derived from the example.
  
  # NN5
  - monash_nn5_weekly
  # - monash_nn5_daily # (If exists, but sticking to what I saw in example)
